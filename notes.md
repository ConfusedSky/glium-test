To complete
[ ] Allow double click to split a point
[ ] Allow saving and loading data
[ ] Have the path following for the curves be fixed length and
    speed along the path regardless of the geometry
[ ] Change the shaders to only take a single matrix rather than using a
    bunch of values and composing them in the shader.
[ ] Allow moving the viewport 
    <- this will probably be the hardest because we already
    have some of the code implemented for all the above but
    implmenting moving the viewport will require changes to
    a lot of the code. Or maybe implmenting the above will
    make this significantly easier.
